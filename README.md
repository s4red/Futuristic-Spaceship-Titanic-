### Market Trends Analysis for Retail Sector - Kaggle Competition

#### Introduction/Description
This project was developed as part of a Kaggle competition representing the newly-formed analytics department of a company. The aim was to apply to analyze market trends within the retail sector and develop predictive models. This project not only serves as a competition entry but also as a significant addition to my analytics portfolio, demonstrating the ability to handle real-world data challenges.

#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels

#### Installation
Follow these steps to get your development environment running:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### Usage
To run this project, follow these steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook Team8_A1.2.ipynb
```
Inside the notebook, execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis from data loading through to model evaluation.

#### Methodology
The methodology for this project is designed to systematically analyze and predict market trends in the retail sector. The steps include:
- **Data Collection:** Gathering historical sales data, customer demographics, and economic indicators.
- **Data Exploration:** Visual and statistical analysis of the data to understand distributions, trends, and correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features to prepare for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that capture relevant market signals and patterns, such as seasonal trends, promotional effects, and customer segments.
- **Model Selection:** Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and time-series models, to identify the best performing model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE (root mean squared error), accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error.
- **Forecasting:** Developing predictive models to forecast future sales and market trends, providing actionable insights for strategic planning.

#### Analysis Overview
The analysis pipeline includes:
- **Data Exploration:** Understanding feature distributions, identifying trends, and visualizing sales patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing it for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that capture relevant market signals and patterns.
- **Model Selection:** Comparing various machine learning algorithms to find the best performer for our specific dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like RMSE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error to evaluate the model's performance.
